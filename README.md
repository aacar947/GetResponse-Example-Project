# GetResponse-Example-Project
 This is a sample newsletter subscription web page project using getresponse-api. You can read more about it on [GetResponse REST Web Service Interface
](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3)
## What is this project all about and why am I created it?
Well, nothing special actually. I am simply new to the web designing and I made this project to improve my skills and hopefully help somebody who intrest in or struggle with GetResponse-Api.
## What is this web page do?
It basically gets an user informations (name, email adress, birthday etc.) then sends that informations to the server (server.js) and that server communicates with GetResponse-Api accordingly. 
Thus you add the user to your GetResponse account's contacts list.
