# GetResponse-Example-Project
 [GetResponse](https://app.getresponse.com/) is an email marketing service and this is a sample newsletter subscription web page project using getresponse-api. You can read more about api on [GetResponse REST Web Service Interface
](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3)
## What is this project all about and why am I created it?
Well, nothing special actually. I am simply new to the web designing and I made this project to improve my skills and hopefully help somebody who intrest in or struggle with GetResponse-Api.
## What does this web page do?
It basically gets a user informations (name, email adress, birthday etc.) then sends that informations to the server (server.js) and that server communicates with GetResponse-Api accordingly. 
And that way you can add the user to your GetResponse account's contacts list using this subsibription web page.
